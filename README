SOAP-WSDL provides a SOAP client with WSDL support.

SUBCLASSING
-----------

SOAP-WSDL is still under very active development. Please don't build
applications using the following modules directly:

 - SOAP::WSDL::Definitions
 - SOAP::WSDL::Port
 - SOAP::WSDL::PortType
 - SOAP::WSDL::Binding
 - SOAP::WSDL::Message
 - SOAP::WSDL::Operation
 - SOAP::WSDL::OpMessage
 - SOAP::WSDL::Part
 - SOAP::WSDL::Service
 - SOAP::WSDL::Types
 - SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Schema

Those will be replaced some time in the future.

INSTALLING
----------

Use the following mantra:

 perl Build.PL
 perl Build
 perl Build test
 perl Build install

If you don't have Module::Build installed, you may also use

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

Note that Module::Build is the recommended installer - make will not run
all tests provided with SOAP-WSDL.

SOLARIS INSTALLATION NOTES
--------------------------
According to a CPAN RT report http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36865
it may be necessary to check (and possibly update) the expat libraries
required by XML::Parser.

SOAP::WSDL's metadata includes XML::Parser, but it seems that the expat
libraries XML::Parser depends on may slip through missing or outdated.
