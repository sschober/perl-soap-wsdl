This type class is derived by union.

Derivation by union is not fully supported yet - value space constraints are
not checked yet.

The current implementation of union resorts to inheriting from the base type,
which means (quoted from the XML Schema specs): "If the <list> or <union>
alternative is chosen, then the simple ur-type definitionÂ·."
