=head1 NAME

SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM - Deserializer SOAP messages into SOM objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use SOAP::WSDL;
 use SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM;
 use SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Deserializer;
 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Deserializer->register( '1.1', __PACKAGE__ );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Deserializer for creating SOAP::Lite's SOM object as result of a SOAP call.

This package is here for two reasons:

=over

=item * Compatibility

You don't have to change the rest of your SOAP::Lite based app when switching
to SOAP::WSDL, but can just use SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM to get back the
same objects as you were used to.

=item * Completeness

SOAP::Lite covers much more of the SOAP specification than SOAP::WSDL.

SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM can be used for content which cannot be
deserialized by L<SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOAP11|SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOAP11>.
This may be XML including mixed content, attachements and other XML data not
(yet) handled by L<SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOAP11|SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOAP11>.

=back

SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM is a subclass of L<SOAP::Deserializer|SOAP::Deserializer>
from the L<SOAP::Lite|SOAP::Lite> package.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 deserialize

Deserializes a XML sting into a SOAP::SOM object. Returns a SOAP::Fault object
on deserialization errors.

=head2 generate_fault

Dies with a SOAP::Fault object.

=head1 USAGE

SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer will not autoregister itself - to use it for a particular
SOAP version just use the following lines:

 my $soap_version = '1.1'; # or '1.2', further versions may appear.

 use SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM;
 use SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Deserializer;
 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Deserializer->register( $soap_version, __PACKAGE__ );

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER CLASSES

=head2 Differences from SOAP::Lite

=over

=item * No on_fault handler

You cannot specify what to do when an error occurs - SOAP::WSDL will return
a SOAP::Fault object on transport errors.

=back

=head2 Differences from other SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer classes

=over

=item * generate_fault

SOAP::WSDL::Deserializer::SOM will die with a SOAP::Fault object on calls
to generate_fault.

This also means that a SOAP::Fault may be thrown as exception when using
