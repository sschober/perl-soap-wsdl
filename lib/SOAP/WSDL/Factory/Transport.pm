=head1 NAME

SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport - Factory for retrieving transport objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # from SOAP::WSDL::Client:
 $transport = SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport->get_transport( $url, @opt );

 # in transport class:
 package MyWickedTransport;
 use SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport;

 # register class as transport module for httpr and https
 # (httpr is "reliable http", a protocol developed by IBM).
 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport->register( 'httpr' , __PACKAGE__ );
 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport->register( 'https' , __PACKAGE__ );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SOAP::WSDL::Transport serves as factory for retrieving transport objects for
SOAP::WSDL.

The actual work is done by specific transport classes.

SOAP::WSDL::Transport tries to load one of the following classes:

=over

=item * the class registered for the scheme via register()

=item * the SOAP::Lite class matching the scheme

=item * the SOAP::WSDL class matching the scheme

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register

 SOAP::WSDL::Transport->register('https', 'MyWickedTransport');

Globally registers a class for use as transport class.

=head2 proxy

 $trans->proxy('http://soap-wsdl.sourceforge.net');

Sets the proxy (endpoint).

Returns the transport for this protocol.

=head2 set_transport

Sets the current transport object.

=head2 get_transport

Gets the current transport object.

=head1 WRITING YOUR OWN TRANSPORT CLASS

=head2 Registering a transport class

Transport classes must be registered with SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport.

This is done by executing the following code where $scheme is the URL scheme
the class should be used for, and $module is the class' module name.

 SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport->register( $scheme, $module);

To auto-register your transport class on loading, execute register() in your
tranport class (see L<SYNOPSIS|SYNOPSIS> above).

Multiple protocols or multiple classes are registered by multiple calls to
register().

=head2 Transport plugin package layout

You may only use transport classes whose name is either
the module name or the module name with '::Client' appended.

=head2 Methods to implement

Transport classes must implement the interface required for SOAP::Lite
transport classes (see L<SOAP::Lite::Transport> for details,
L<SOAP::WSDL::Transport::HTTP|SOAP::WSDL::Transport::HTTP> for an example).

To provide this interface, transport modules must implement the following
methods:

=over

=item * new

=item * send_receive

Dispatches a request and returns the content of the response.

=item * code

Returns the status code of the last send_receive call (if any).

=item * message

Returns the status message of the last send_receive call (if any).

=item * status

Returns the status of the last send_receive call (if any).

=item * is_success

Returns true after a send_receive was successful, false if it was not.

=back

SOAP::Lite requires transport modules to pack client and server
classes in one file, and to follow this naming scheme:

 Module name:
   "SOAP::Transport::" . uc($scheme)

 Client class (additional package in module):
   "SOAP::Transport::" . uc($scheme) . "::Client"

 Server class (additional package in module):
   "SOAP::Transport::" . uc($scheme) . "::Client"

SOAP::WSDL does not require you to follow these restrictions.

There is only one restriction in SOAP::WSDL:

You may only use transport classes whose name is either the module name or
the module name with '::Client' appended.

SOAP::WSDL will try to instantiate an object of your transport class with
'::Client' appended to allow using transport classes written for SOAP::Lite.

This may lead to errors when a different module with the name of your
transport module suffixed with ::Client is also loaded.
