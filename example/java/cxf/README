This is an example for creating a Apache CXF based client for a SOAP::WSDL
based SOAP server.

The example contains a pom.xml for building CXF based SOAP Clients from
a WSDL, a test Spring context configuration, and a JUnit4 test class for
testing the generated client.

It is intended to run against the HTTP::Server::Simple based SOAP server
in example/server/hello_simple.pl

To run the example, fire up the test server by calling

 perl example/server/hello_simple.pl

Then open a second terminal and run

 mvn test

The included JUnit test should pass.
